The game is played on a 3x3 vertical grid.\n2. Players take turns setting one of their pieces into any available slot.\n",
            "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! It's a classic game of wits. Your goal is simple: get three of your marks in a row before your opponent does. Player 1 is 'O' and Player 2 is 'X'. The board is a 3x3 grid where empty slots are represented by '.'. On your turn, just pick an empty spot to place your mark. A winning line can be straight across (horizontal), up and down (vertical), or slanted (diagonal). If the board fills up and no one has won, it's a draw. Good luck!",

This can be in any row, any column, or across either of the two main diagonals.\n\n*How does a turn work?*\nWhen it's your turn, select any unoccupied square on the 3x3 board ('.') to place your piece.\n\n*What if no one wins?*\nIf all nine squares are filled and no winning line has been formed, the game ends in a tie."
